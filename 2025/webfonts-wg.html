        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Web Fonts WG is developing a technology, 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IFT/">Incremental Font Transfer</a>, 
          whereby the  client loads only the portion(s) of the font that they 
          actually need, significantly reducing data transfer. Multiple incremental 
          additions to the same font are possible, such as a user agent updating 
          a font as a user browses multiple pages. 
          This is especially helpful for languages with large character repertoires,
          such as Chinese and Japanese.
          Incremental transfer improves on unicode-range by avoiding damage to 
          layout (kerning, ligatures, etc) rules, meaning it can efficiently 
          support fine grained increments to Latin and to complex scripts 
          like Indic or Arabic.
          Incremental fonts can be deployed as static files to any standard HTTP server.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Web Fonts WG develops Recommendation-track specifications for Incremental Font Transfer as listed under deliverables; tracks emerging implementations, and maintains communications with the typography, Web design and implementor communities.
        <p>Maintenance updates to the WOFF 1 and WOFF 2 specifications are also in scope.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>          

          <dl>
            <dt id="IFT" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IFT/" rel="versionof">Incremental Font Transfer</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This specification defines a method to incrementally transfer fonts from server to client. Incremental transfer allows clients to load only the portions of the font they actually need which speeds up font loads and reduces data transfer needed to load the fonts. A font can be loaded over multiple requests where each request incrementally adds additional data.</p>

          <p>In addition, the Working Group maintains the following W3C normative specifications:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt id="WOFF" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/" rel="versionof">WOFF File Format 1.0</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>WOFF provides lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data for use with CSS @font-face.</p>
<p><b>Latest publication:</b> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-WOFF-20121213/">2012-12-13</a></p>
</dd>
            <dt id="WOFF2" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/" rel="versionof">WOFF File Format 2.0</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Based on experience with WOFF 1.0, which is widely deployed, this specification was developed to provide improved compression and thus lower use of network bandwidth, while still allowing fast decompression even on mobile devices. This is achieved by combining a content-aware preprocessing step and improved entropy coding, compared to the Flate compression used in WOFF 1.0.</p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance beyond
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Relevance and momentum -->

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
